/**
 * #1633 — the single source of truth for this app's environment contract.
 *
 * Historically every environment variable was read at its point of use, each
 * with its own ad-hoc `Number()` / `=== "true"` parsing. That made typos silent
 * (a misspelled key is indistinguishable from an unset one), let a secret be
 * accidentally prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` and shipped to the browser, and left no
 * single place that could answer "what does this app read from the environment,
 * and what shape must each value have?".
 *
 * This module is that place. It declares `ENV_CONTRACT` — every variable the
 * app reads, with its scope, whether it is required, whether it is a secret,
 * and the shape its value must have — plus the two readers.
 *
 * Validation lives in `./envSchema`, which turns the contract into Zod schemas.
 * That split is deliberate and load-bearing:
 *
 * - This module has **no runtime dependencies**, so it stays importable from
 *   `"use client"` components (`Navbar`, `WalletContext`, `DevMockPanel`).
 * - `zod` is not in the client bundle today: every consumer of `./schemas` is
 *   an API route. Importing Zod from here would add it to the main chunk, so
 *   `./envSchema` is server-only by construction and nothing here imports it.
 *
 * When you add an environment variable, add it to `envContract.ts` and read it
 * through the matching reader. Do not add a bare `process.env.X` read.
 *
 * @see ./envContract for the contract table itself.
 * @see ./envSchema for the Zod schemas and validation entry points.
 * @see docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md for the developer-facing documentation.
